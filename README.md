# What are the most prolific agents on funda?

## Running locally

You can run this project from an IDE, it has necessary configuration in appsettings.json files. Usually, api key would be stored in a Key Vault (or user secrets in a local environment), but given the nature of assignment it's just hardcoded in the config file.

After starting the project, you can navigate to http://localhost:5000 to use the API with a small Blazor UI.
